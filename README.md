Filter content by css classes with AND statement in vanilla JavaScript

To work with script you to add class that all elements contain and need to make event listener
to some element like checkbox and call main function and give class name to it or 
call it by something like html onclick.

Problems and possible solutions:
caching of the form 
for a example :
after refreshing page checkboxes keeps their condition
solution:
Add html inputs into form and disable autocomplete
example: <form autocomplete = "off">
